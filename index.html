            <p class="st-1">Elephant and Friends Story
                A lone elephant wandered the forest looking for friends. She came across a monkey and asked, “Will you be my friend, monkey?” “You are too big and cannot swing on trees as I do. So I cannot be your friend”, said the monkey.
                
                The elephant them came across a rabbit and asked him if she could be his friend. “You are too big to fit inside my burrow. You cannot be my friend”, replied the rabbit.

            <p class="st-1-2">Then the elephant met a frog and asked if she could be her friend. The frog said “You are too big and heavy. You cannot jump like me. I am sorry, but you cannot be my friend”</p>

            <p class="st-1-3">The elephant asked a fox, and he got the same reply, that he was too big. The next day, all the animals in the forest were running in fear. The elephant stopped a bear and asked what was happening and was told that a tiger has been attacking all the animals.

                The elephant wanted to save the other weak animals and went to the tiger and said “Please sir, leave my friends alone. Do not eat them”. The tiger didn’t listen and asked the elephant to mind her own business. Seeing no other way to solve the problem, the elephant kicked the tiger and scared it away.
                
                She then went back to the others and told them what happened. On hearing how the elephant saved their lives, the animals agreed in unison, “You are just the right size to be our friend”.
                
                Moral: Friends come in all shapes and sizes!.</p>

                <p class="st-2">Once upon a time, there was a beautiful, kind-hearted girl called Cinderella, who lived in a far far away land. She lived with her stepmother, Lady Tremaine, and two step-sisters, Anastasia and Drizella. As her stepmother was not very fond of her, she had asked Cinderella to live in the attic. Two cute little mice named Gus and Jaq and the chirping birds became her best friends in her new room. 


                    Her stepmother and stepsisters made her do all their household chores. Cinderella woke up early in the morning when it was still all dark to start the fire for their household. She cooked all meals, worked in the kitchen, and kept the fire going to warm their house. Poor Cinderella used to get ashes and cinders all over her clothes and body from the fire. People say her real name was Ella, but her stepsisters and stepmother called her Cinderella as she always had cinders on her clothes. 
                    
                    
                    Anastasia and Drizella were arrogant and quarrelsome. They never happened to like Cinderella much and made her life miserable. They made her run on errands for them. Cooking, sewing, and cleaning were all done by Cinderella. 
                    
                    
                    Lady Tremaine enjoyed seeing Cinderella work so hard. She cunningly gave extra work to Cinderella, like asking her to bathe her cat, Lucifer. She did everything that she could to make Lady Tremaine, Anastasia, and Drizella happy.   </p><br><br>

                        One fine morning, the king’s messengers came riding on their horses and announced that the King and the Queen had invited all the maiden ladies of the kingdom to a royal ball. The King and the Queen were to find the Prince a lovely bride. The young ladies were overjoyed with this news. They started to decide on their best ball gowns and jewellery. 


                    Soon, the king’s messenger arrived at Cinderella’s home and handed over the invitation to the ball. Lady Tremaine now ordered Cinderella to stitch two beautiful new gowns for Anastasia and Drizella for the royal ball. She kept Cinderella busy with more chores so that she wouldn’t be going to the ball. Cinderella wished to go to the ball as well. So, she found her mother’s old dress from her trunk. She thought to herself that she could make the dress into a beautiful new one fit for the royal ball. 


                     Soon, the day of the royal ball arrived, and Anastasia and Drizella were dressed up in the beautiful gowns stitched by Cinderella. Meanwhile, in the attic, Gus and Jaq, the two little mice, and the birds had turned Cinderella’s mother’s old dress into a beautiful one. They had used the ribbons and beads thrown away by Cinderella’s stepsisters to make Cinderella’s dress. 

                     Cinderella was very happy to see her new dress done by the mice and the birds. <br><br>She looked so pretty in that beautiful gown and the amazing glass slippers that the Fairy Godmother created for her. But she didn’t have a carriage to go to the ball. So, the Fairy Godmother waved her magic wand on a pumpkin and turned it into a fine carriage for Cinderella. She tapped her wand on the little mice and turned them into Cinderella’s carriage-men. 

                     The Fairy Godmother told Cinderella to go to the ball and have fun. She added, “Remember my child, all this magic spell will vanish at the stroke of midnight. Come back before that.” 

                     Cinderella promised to be back before midnight and left happily for the ball in the carriage drawn by Gus and Jaq. When Cinderella arrived at the palace, she was surprised to see a place so majestic and a ball so grand. There were so many young ladies escorted by their mothers. Everyone wanted to impress the Prince. But the Prince was at a loss. He didn’t know where to look or who to dance with. 

                     When Cinderella entered the royal ball, all heads turned to see her. She looked like a dream. No one happened to recognize her, even her stepmother and stepsisters were awestruck to see a girl so beautiful. Cinderella walked into the ballroom with her head held high. She looked so royal that everyone thought her to be some princess. </p><br><br>

<p class="st-2-2">The Prince was overjoyed to have found his love. He didn’t care about the cinders on her hair but looked into her eyes. “I found you!” he said and took Cinderella off with him. Lady Tremaine and her two daughters grew red with anger, and Cinderella’s friends Gus and Jaq rejoiced. The Prince married Cinderella and they lived happily ever after, in the palace</p>
